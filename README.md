## About Me
I am an AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist passionate about building **scalable, high-impact AI systems** that bridge research and real-world applications.  
I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Arizona State University**, where I also serve as a **Research Assistant**, working on **agent-based models extended into Graph Neural Network (GNN) frameworks** for analyzing complex systems.  

My expertise spans **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Explainable AI, and Multi-Agent Systems**. I have extensive experience with **Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)**, turning advanced AI concepts into production-ready solutions.

## How I Work
- I approach problems with a mix of **research curiosity and engineering discipline**, ensuring solutions are both innovative and practical.  
- I thrive in **dynamic, fast-paced environments**, where iteration and adaptability matter more than perfection.  
- I believe in **clarity and scalability**: everything I build is meant to last and adapt as systems evolve.  
- I’ve led and collaborated with **distributed teams across multiple time zones**, developing strong communication and leadership skills.  
- I value **deep work, structured thinking, and ownership** — once I take on a problem, I see it through to the end.

## Fun Facts
- I am **ambidextrous** — using my left hand for sports and right hand for academics.  
- I started my tech journey at **18**, when I built an AR brochure application that generated real revenue.  
- I’ve been involved in both **engineering and athletics**: I train at elite-level sports while also pushing myself intellectually.  
- I enjoy exploring **frontiers where AI meets human potential** — from voice isolation systems to agent-based modeling of real-world interactions.

## Core Values
- **Discipline over motivation** — consistency creates results.  
- **Simplicity in execution** — the best solutions are often the clearest and most efficient.  
- **Relentless learning** — whether in AI, sports, or life, I’m always iterating and improving.  
- **Collaboration with impact** — I work best when solving problems that matter with teams that care.  

---

## Current Focus
- Expanding my expertise in **Graph Neural Networks** and **real-time ML applications**.  
- Improving **data structures, algorithms, and system design skills** to prepare for top-tier engineering roles.  
- Building projects that highlight my ability to deliver **end-to-end AI pipelines** — from ideation to deployment.  
- Positioning myself for impactful AI roles in industry, particularly at companies where **scalability, innovation, and impact** intersect.
